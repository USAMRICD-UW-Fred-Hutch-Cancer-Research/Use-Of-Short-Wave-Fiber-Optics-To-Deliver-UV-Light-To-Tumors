# Use-Of-Short-Wave-Fiber-Optics-To-Deliver-UV-Light-To-Tumors
Inserting a fiber optic strand into a tumor is a minimally invasive method of sanitizing a virus vesicle. The fiber optic strand would be inserted via Endoscopic Surgery. The strand would deliver ultra-high-intensity light to the tumor.

"Insert the fiber strand into the mouth of the virus. When the virus accepts the strand into the mouth, turn on the UV light at full power. The whole virus will turn white and its dead." -Melvin Bouboublis @FredHutch

## Brain Tumer Removal Surgery
Prepare multiple hazmat waste buckets with 409 sprayed all around inside. 

Prepare 2 endospcopes with attached low-frequency fiber optic strands and UV source. Fiber strand terminates at 1 cm from endoscope tip. Adjust for surgery.

Prepare 1 endoscope with hydrogen peroxide spray tube and UV. 000

Coat patients mouth, throat, and airways with carmex.

Instruct patient to "not swallow" ANYTHING during surgery. Instruct patient in coughing or vomiting virus load into waste bucket. 

Prepare 5 cups nutmeg, 5 cups turmeric, & 3 cups creatine with 1 gallon distilled water.

Prepare 2 500mg Niacin, 2 100mg Zinc.

Prepare patient's lips with carmex to prevent lip injury during vomiting or coughing up virus and vessicle tumor.

Enter nasal channel with endoscope. Locate vesicle tumor cavity.

Enter mouth with fiber optic strand. Stick 1cm fiber into tumor gape (vesicle opening). Assistant turns power on immediately.

As soon as the virus load uses legs to begin pullout, pull equipment from mouth.

Use nasal endoscope to press fiber into flesh ~4mm from gape. Power UV on to create effect that UV is shining in tumor.

The intention is to drive the viral load from the vesicle tumor.

Assist the patient through coughing up the virus. Procedure is done over waste bin. Leave UV on.

As soon as the virus load is in the bin, administer neosporin into the sinuses to create barrier for surgeon.

Enter vesicle tumor with endoscope starting with fiber.

5 minutes: Hit every inside surface of vesicle sack with UV.

The sack with melt onto the endoscope.

Pull meltdown through neosporin coated nasal channel AS SLOW AS POSSIBLE.

IF YOU DO IT TOO QUICK MELTDOWN WILL STING SINUS WITH NEMATACYST.

Fill sinus with neosporin.

Stick new endoscope into nasal cavity with hydrogen peroxide. Aggresively spray hydrogen peroxide into wound until clean solution is rinsing out for 4 minutes.

REPEAT 3 TIMES {Use elongated tube through nasal to fill vesicle tumor with neosporin. Fill with pressure.

Rinse aggressively with hydrogen peroxide.}

Fill wound with neosporin with pressure.

Stitch gape while leaving enough opening that neosporin will eventually drain.

Patients must take daily to exit Matrix (wound healing & prevent re-infection):

1000mg AlnayaSN

300mg TsinKX with food

mg HaldEX

mg MusKT

mg KureaSH

1 Gallon distilled water
