# Use-Of-Short-Wave-Fiber-Optics-To-Deliver-UV-Light-To-Tumors
Inserting a fiber optic strand into a tumor is a minimally invasive method of sanitizing a virus vesicle. The fiber optic strand would be inserted via Endoscopic Surgery. The strand would deliver ultra-high-intensity light to the tumor.

"Insert the fiber strand into the mouth of the virus. When the virus accepts the strand into the mouth, turn on the UV light at full power. The whole virus will turn white and its dead." -Melvin Bouboublis @FredHutch
