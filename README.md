# Use-Of-Short-Wave-Fiber-Optics-To-Deliver-UV-Light-To-Tumors
Inserting a fiber optic strand into a tumor is a minimally invasive method of sanitizing a virus vesicle. The fiber optic strand would be inserted via Endoscopic Surgery. The strand would deliver ultra-high-intensity light to the tumor.

"Insert the fiber strand into the mouth of the virus. When the virus accepts the strand into the mouth, turn on the UV light at full power. The whole virus will turn white and its dead." -Melvin Bouboublis @FredHutch

## Brain Tumor Removal Surgery
Prepare multiple hazmat waste buckets with 409 sprayed all around inside. 

Prepare 2 endoscopes with attached low-frequency fiber optic strands and UV source. The fiber strand terminates at 1 cm from the endoscope tip. Adjust for surgery.

Prepare 1 endoscope with hydrogen peroxide spray tube and UV. 000

Coat the patient's mouth, throat, and airways with Carmex.

Instruct patient to "not swallow" ANYTHING during surgery. Instruct patient in coughing or vomiting virus load into the waste bucket. 

Prepare 5 cups nutmeg, 5 cups turmeric, & 3 cups creatine with 1 gallon of distilled water.

Prepare 2 500mg Niacin, and 2 100mg Zinc.

Prepare the patient's lips with Carmex to prevent lip injury during vomiting or coughing up the virus and vesicle tumor.

Enter the nasal channel with the endoscope. Locate the vesicle tumor cavity.

Enter mouth with fiber optic strand. Stick 1cm fiber into the tumor gape (vesicle opening). The assistant turns the power on immediately.

As soon as the virus load uses the legs to begin pullout, pull equipment from the mouth.

Use nasal endoscope to press fiber into flesh ~4mm from gape. Power UV on to create the effect that UV is shining in the tumor.

The intention is to drive the viral load from the vesicle tumor.

Assist the patient through coughing up the virus. The procedure is done over a waste bin. Leave UV on.

As soon as the virus load is in the bin, administer Neosporin into the sinuses to create a barrier for the surgeon.

Enter the vesicle tumor with an endoscope starting with fiber.

5 minutes: Hit every inside surface of the vesicle sack with UV.

The sack with melt onto the endoscope.

Pull meltdown through the neosporin-coated nasal channel AS SLOW AS POSSIBLE.

IF YOU DO IT TOO QUICKLY MELTDOWN WILL STING THE SINUS WITH NEMATACYST.

Fill the sinus with Neosporin.

Stick the new endoscope into the nasal cavity with hydrogen peroxide. Aggressively spray hydrogen peroxide into the wound until a clean solution is rinsed out for 4 minutes.

REPEAT 3 TIMES {Use elongated tube through nasal to fill vesicle tumor with Neosporin. Fill with pressure.

Rinse aggressively with hydrogen peroxide.}

Fill the wound with Neosporin with pressure.

Stitch the gape while leaving enough opening that Neosporin will eventually drain.

Patients must take daily to exit Matrix (wound healing & prevent re-infection):

1000mg AlnayaSN

300mg TsinKX with food

mg HaldEX

mg MusKT

mg KureaSH

1 Gallon distilled water

## Ovarian Tumor Removal

Prepare multiple hazmat waste buckets with 409 or WD40 sprayed all around inside. 

Prepare 2 endoscopes with attached low-frequency fiber optic strands and UV source. The fiber strand terminates at 1 cm from the endoscope tip. Adjust for surgery.

Prepare 5 cups nutmeg, 5 cups turmeric, & 3 cups creatine with 1 gallon of distilled water.

The patient must consume the nutmeg, turmeric, and water within 36 hours of surgery.

Insert endoscope.

coat uterus with Neosporin.

coat vagina with neosporin.

coat inner thighs and pubic area with Carmex.

Attack ovarian virus with UV.

The virus will exit the vagina into the waste bin.

Enter the ovary with a UV endoscope.

Enter the vesicle tumor with an endoscope starting with fiber.

5 minutes: Hit every inside surface of the vesicle sack with UV.

The sack with melt onto the endoscope.

Pull meltdown through the Neosporin-coated vagina channel AS SLOW AS POSSIBLE.

IF YOU DO IT TOO QUICKLY MELTDOWN WILL STING THE SINUS WITH NEMATACYST.

Clean ovaries and womb aggressively with hydrogen peroxide.

Pump ovaries and womb full of neosporin and carmex.

Patients must take daily to exit Matrix (womb healing & prevent re-infection):

1000mg AlnayaSN

300mg TsinKX with food

mg HaldEX

mg MusKT

mg KureaSH

1 Gallon distilled water
