# Use-Of-Short-Wave-Fiber-Optics-To-Deliver-UV-Light-To-Tumors
Inserting a fiber optic strand into a tumor is a minimally invasive method of sanitizing a virus vesicle. The fiber optic strand would be inserted via Endoscopic Surgery. The strand would deliver ultra-high-intensity light to the tumor.

"Insert the fiber strand into the mouth of the virus. When the virus accepts the strand into the mouth, turn on the UV light at full power. The whole virus will turn white and its dead." -Melvin Bouboublis @FredHutch

## Surgery
Prepare multiple hazmat waste buckets with 409 sprayed all around inside. 

Prepare 2 endospcopes with attached low-frequency fiber optic strands and UV source. Fiber strand terminates at 1 cm from endoscope tip. Adjust for surgery.

Instruct patient to "not swallow" ANYTHING during surgery. Instruct patient in coughing or vomiting virus load into waste bucket. 

Prepare 5 cups nutmeg, 5 cups turmeric, & 3 cups creatine with 1 gallon distilled water.

Prepare 2 500mg Niacin, 2 100mg Zinc.

Prepare patient's lips with carmex to prevent lip injury during vomiting or coughing up virus and vessicle tumor.

Enter nasal channel with endoscope. Locate vesicle tumor cavity.

Enter mouth with fiber optic strand. Stick 1cm fiber into tumor gape (vesicle opening). Assistant turns power on immediately.

As soon as the virus load uses legs to begin pullout, pull equipment from mouth.

Use nasal endoscope to press fiber into flesh ~4mm from gape. Power UV on to create effect that UV is shining in tumor.

The intention is to drive the viral load from the vesicle tumor.

Assist the patient through coughing up the virus. Procedure is done over waste bin.

As soon as the virus load is in the bin, administer the pill. Patients family often try to steal pills. Give them their own and let them watch on zoom.

Use elongated tube through nasal to fill vesicle tumor with neosporin. Fill with pressure.
